There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Bookshelf ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

## The online library — organize and track which books you're reading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

## Summary ##
  Bookshelf is your personal library in the cloud. Use it to archive old favorites, keep a record of each book's best quotes, and maintain a running list of what you plan to read next! You can also show off your library on social media and compete with friends to see who is reading the most. Keep reading and watch your library grow. If someone is curious about what you're reading or have read so far this year, just link them to your Bookshelf.

## Problem ##
  Avid readers like to reccomend and share books with one another, but it's hard to recall every great book on the spot. When you get a good reccomendation from someone else, it's often forgotten among the dozens of titles in your head that you 'plan to read next'. And sometimes, you want to share a passage or insightful quote with someone, but can't remember the book it came from!

## Solution ##
  Bookshelf solves these problems and more by tracking the books you've read, saving favorite quotes, and storing a running list of books to read in the future.

## Quote from You ##
  "Manual data entry has never been so fun!"

## How to Get Started ##
  You can start building your library by simply filling out the title and author of a book you've read.

## Customer Quote ##
  "Seeing my library grow over time has been a rewarding experience and encourages me to read even more!" —Nate Graf

## Closing and Call to Action ##
