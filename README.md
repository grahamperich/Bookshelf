# Bookshelf #

## The online library — organize and track which books you're reading ##

## Summary ##
  Bookshelf is your personal library in the cloud. Use it to archive old favorites, keep a record of each book's best quotes, and maintain a running list of what you plan to read next! You can also show off your library on social media and compete with friends to see who is reading the most. Keep reading and watch your library grow. If someone is curious about what you're reading or have read so far this year, just link them to your Bookshelf.

## Problem ##
  Avid readers like to reccomend and share books with one another, but it's hard to recall every great book on the spot. When you get a good reccomendation from someone else, it's often forgotten among the dozens of titles in your head that you 'plan to read next'. And sometimes, you want to share a passage or insightful quote with someone, but can't remember the book it came from!

## Solution ##
  Bookshelf solves these problems and more by tracking the books you've read, saving favorite quotes, and storing a running list of books to read in the future.
